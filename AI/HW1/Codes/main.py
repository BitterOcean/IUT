 # Problem Declaration :
     Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river,
     along with a boat that can hold one or two people.
     Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group
     of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.

 # Works Done :
    * Problem formulation
      (so it can be solved by searching)
    * Computer implementation in order to experimentally compare the
      performance of the BFS and the DFS search strategy.

 # For performance comparisonâ€Œ I use :
    * Time
    * Number of nodes explored
    * Number of nodes expanded
    * Effective branching factor

 # Extra Options :
    * This implementation is able to deal with a scaled-up version of this problem
     (for example, a problem with five missionaries and five cannibals).

 # The implementation has :
    * m number of missionaries,
    * c number of cannibals,
    * k number of maximum allowable passengers in the boat.
    * Search cut-off limit :
        ** Time Limit
        ** Node Limit
           (for example termination :
            after 30 seconds,or
            after 1,000,000 nodes have been expanded)
