The pay slip system is part of the corporate organizational management program for companies and startups,
with the ability to support a variety of files on common payroll programs in the market.
In general, this system receives the receipt in the form of an Excel file and sends the receipts 
to the personnel card in the form of specific tables.
In this way, the receipts are archived monthly without the need for printing and the program is 
responsive at any time. They can be viewed with mobile phones, tablets, etc., and the person can print them 
in a variety of file formats.

## **Project Excellence**

Due to the increasing number of companies and start-ups, as well as the right of employees to know 
the exact details of salaries and benefits, companies and startups inevitably resort to one of the following two methods:  

  1- Paper presentation of payslips  
  
  2- Use of software to issue payslips  
  
The first method is the worst choice for corporate executives,(Due to the large use of paper, 
the difficulties of face-to-face delivery, the non-documentation of all receipts in different years,
the lack of easy access to them and the difficulties of physical archiving of receipts)
The second method is 100% suitable for large organizations and companies that have the ability to pay
heavy fees for optimal sites, but it is very expensive for smaller companies with an average of 
about 200 employees or even less, so the figure is The advantages of this method over the first method 
are that the managers of these companies, due to the inability to bear the exorbitant costs of designing
and supporting the site, resort to the first method or use low security sites without support. 
But at a lower cost, they are satisfied.
 
 
## **Project Goals**

With the aim of covering such problems in small companies and startups, our team has decided to launch 
a comprehensive and complete site for all these companies. This decision was made while there has never
been such a site in Iran. The site also provides a ready-made platform for sending and receiving legal 
receipts, and companies can meet their needs by purchasing user accounts for their desired time and taking 
into account the number of employees, at a much lower cost.
 
 
## **Economic justification**

In addition to the benefits that this project will bring to corporate executives, it will also benefit our team.
For example, this project is Scaleable; This means that we start with low resources and then expand resources as 
customers grow, based on their new needs. According to initial estimates of the host and domain for launching the 
site, as well as the annual cost of the company's account with an average of 200 employees, with the first company 
that buys a one-year account, the profitability of the site begins.


## **Work packages** 

According to the main roles of the system, which are "manager" and "employee", we have the following workpackages:
  1. Search: The ability to search employee and company information in system database
  2. login: The ability for employees and managers to enter as the main roles of the system
  3. Display information: Possibility of graphical presentation of payslips in employee communication and presentation of graphs of statistical analysis
  4. Payslip management: Possibility of uploading monthly payslip information by manager, in two ways:  
    - "Manual entry of information" in pre-prepared forms inside the site or  
    - "Upload past files in Excel format" and also the ability to edit and delete them  
  5. Employee Management: The ability to add employees manually or with files as well as the ability to delete and edit employees' information
  6. Management of Payslips' forms: Ability to delete, add and edit legal receipt fields


## **Future work**  

    1. Doing this project improves the experience of the group members in the field of teamwork as well as web programming.  
    2. This project is a commercial innovation in Iran, so it can be a brilliant project in the resume of each member of the team,
    which will have a significant impact on the future of work and education.  
    3. Carrying out this project will expand business relations with other companies, which will promote the career advancement 
    of members (in the future).  
    4. Since this project also has a revenue-generating aspect, if it is done properly and successfully, it can be registered as
    a startup and create jobs for team members.  
Attention ! This project does not have the ability to be published in the form of an article or scientific report.  


## **Exchange**  

    The exchanges between our technical team and the customer are divided into two general categories:  
    1. During the design and in order to accurately explain the face of the problem (using prototyping methods)  
    2. After presenting different versions of the project as an unofficial feedback or using the system's official 
    support system (by designing and implementing an active support system, exchanges between us and customers 
    in the form of questions and answers, as well as the transfer of criticism and feedback accelerate and Is facilitated.)  


## **Advertising and marketing**  

In order to attract customers and marketing, our team seeks to hold transparency meetings in the area of project 
necessity and cost-effectiveness for companies and startups.  
These briefings can be held in person or at various festivals and exhibitions, including Autocom or video conferencing.

## **Possible schedule**

The Legal Fish System project is supposed to be a web-based application.
To develop, we use the phased model so that we can add new features to the project according to their needs 
during the implementation of the original plan using the feedback of the users. Also, due to lack of time, 
this model helps us to publish the initial version of the project as soon as possible. During the implementation
of the project, we can consult with the managers of the companies and new startups, and in addition to attracting
them, we will know our customers better and provide new facilities for the project.
The first phase of the project includes the core system and its basic and essential features, including: almost complete implementation of search modules, login, payroll management, employee management, form management and display of information and statistical reports.
In the next phases, the possibility of Massage Passing between the employee and the manager will be added to the system.

## **Dangers**  

Among the dangers that may threaten the site:  
    1. Site security issues and the ability of users to access the legal files of others  
       &emsp; - This problem can be solved by considering security issues and using up-to-date technologies.  
    2. Customer unattractiveness is estimated  
       &emsp; - This problem can probably be solved by acquiring knowledge and using different marketing methods.  
    3. It is possible to face a lack of resources and memory or bandwidth  
       &emsp; - With host upgrade this type of resource shortage can be solved.
