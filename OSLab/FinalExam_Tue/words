I
am
a
good
student
I
love
university
happy
end
of
the
semester
I
have
a
nice
plan
for
my
future
A
single-tasking
system
can
only
run
one
program
at
a
time
while
a
multi-tasking
operating
system
allows
more
than
one
program
to
be
running
in
concurrency
This
is
achieved
by
time-sharing
where
the
available
processor
time
is
divided
between
multiple
processes
These
processes
are
each
interrupted
repeatedly
in
time
slices
by
a
task-scheduling
subsystem
of
the
operating
system
Multi-tasking
may
be
characterized
in
preemptive
and
cooperative
types
In
preemptive
multitasking
the
operating
system
slices
the
CPU
time
and
dedicates
a
slot
to
each
of
the
programs
